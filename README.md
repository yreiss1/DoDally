## General info

DoDally allows users to create tasks to be completed, but for each task users can browse through a list of classroom proposals written and posted by teachers seeking extra funding for improvements that would benefit the students. The data is provided by the Donors Choose API. After users select a cause they are prompted to name the task, selects an amount of money, and a deadline for when the task is to be completed. If the task does not get completed by that time, the amount of money specified by the user when creating the task gets donated to that classroom. Users are also able to cheer each other on to complete goals, creating a productive community.

## Inspiration

I was inspired by my girlfriend, who is a teacher for a class of twelve 2 year olds. We often discuss the state of classrooms in America and how many classrooms in America really lack the necessary funds needed to provide a quality education. People spend tons of money to get an educational step up in high school and especially in college but most people don't know that it's these first formative years that are most likely to determine the level of academic, social, and behavioural ability that a child will reach later on in life. That is why I felt that it is crucial and of utmost importance to use my knowledge to construct a hack to provide funding to these often overlooked classrooms. In addition to helping teachers and students I also wished to help myself and those like me who benefit from having an incentive to complete certain tasks.
